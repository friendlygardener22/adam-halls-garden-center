    excerpt: 'Get your garden off to a great start with our comprehensive spring planting guide. Learn when to plant, what to plant, and how to care for your new seedlings.',
    content: `Spring is the perfect time to start your gardening journey! As the weather warms up and the days get longer, your garden is ready for new life.

## When to Start Planting

The best time to start planting depends on your location and the specific plants you want to grow. Generally, you can begin planting:
- Hardy vegetables: 2-4 weeks before the last frost
- Tender vegetables: After the last frost
- Annual flowers: After the last frost
- Perennials: Early spring or fall

## What to Plant in Spring

### Vegetables
- **Early Spring**: Peas, spinach, lettuce, radishes
- **Mid Spring**: Carrots, beets, broccoli, cabbage
- **Late Spring**: Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, beans

### Flowers
- **Early Spring**: Pansies, violas, snapdragons
- **Mid Spring**: Marigolds, zinnias, cosmos
- **Late Spring**: Sunflowers, dahlias, gladiolus

## Essential Tools You'll Need

1. **Garden trowel** - For digging small holes
2. **Hand rake** - For leveling soil and removing debris
3. **Watering can** - For gentle watering of seedlings
4. **Garden gloves** - To protect your hands
5. **Plant markers** - To identify your plants

## Step-by-Step Planting Process

1. **Prepare the soil** - Remove weeds and loosen the soil
2. **Add compost** - Mix in organic matter for nutrients
3. **Create planting holes** - Make holes appropriate for your seeds/seedlings
4. **Plant carefully** - Place seeds or seedlings at the right depth
5. **Water gently** - Give your new plants a good drink
6. **Mulch** - Add a layer of mulch to retain moisture

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Planting too early** - Wait for the right soil temperature
- **Overwatering** - Let the soil dry slightly between waterings
- **Planting too deep** - Follow the depth guidelines on seed packets
- **Ignoring spacing** - Give plants room to grow

## Caring for Your Spring Garden

- **Water regularly** - Keep soil consistently moist but not soggy
- **Fertilize appropriately** - Use balanced fertilizer for most plants
- **Monitor for pests** - Check plants regularly for signs of damage
- **Thin seedlings** - Remove extra plants to give others room to grow

Remember, gardening is a learning process. Don't be discouraged if some plants don't make it - every gardener has failures. The important thing is to keep trying and learning from your experiences.

Happy planting! üå±`,

3. **Choose the right pot size** - Too big pots can lead to overwatering
4. **Observe your plants** - They'll tell you what they need through their appearance
5. **Be patient** - Plants grow slowly, so don't expect instant results

## When to Worry

Even these tough plants can have issues. Watch for:
- **Yellow leaves** - Usually means overwatering
- **Brown tips** - Often indicates underwatering or low humidity
- **Drooping** - Check soil moisture
- **No new growth** - May need more light or fertilizer

## The Bottom Line
