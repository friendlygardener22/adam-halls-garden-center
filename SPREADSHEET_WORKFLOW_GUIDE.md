## üöÄ Quick Start: Spreadsheet-Based Product Management

This guide shows you how to easily add and change product information using spreadsheets - much faster than editing individual files!

## üìã Available Spreadsheet Tools

### 1. **Export Current Data** (`scripts/export_to_spreadsheet.py`)
Creates a complete editable spreadsheet with all 890 products.

### 2. **Priority Spreadsheet** (`scripts/create_priority_spreadsheet.py`)
Creates a focused spreadsheet with only products that need attention.

### 3. **Import Updated Data** (`scripts/import_priority_spreadsheet.py`)
Imports your edited priority spreadsheet back into the website.

## üîÑ Recommended Workflow

### **Step 1: Create Priority Spreadsheet**
```bash
python scripts/create_priority_spreadsheet.py
```
This creates `priority_products_[timestamp].csv` with only products needing attention.

### **Step 2: Edit in Excel/Google Sheets**
- Open the CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets
- Fill in the missing information in the "new_" columns
- Save the file

### **Step 3: Import Back to Website**
```bash
python scripts/import_priority_spreadsheet.py
```
This updates your website with the new information from the priority spreadsheet.

new_height: "3-5 ft"
new_width: "2-3 ft"
```

## üîß Advanced Workflow

### **Batch Processing:**
1. Create priority spreadsheet
2. Sort by priority_score (highest first)
3. Work on 10-20 products at a time
4. Import after each batch
5. Check website to see improvements

### **Team Collaboration:**
1. Create priority spreadsheet
2. Split products among team members
3. Each person works on their assigned products
4. Combine all spreadsheets
5. Import final version

### **Quality Control:**
1. Import spreadsheet
2. Check website for formatting
3. Fix any issues in spreadsheet
4. Re-import if needed

## üìà Progress Tracking

After each import, you'll see:
- How many products now have descriptions
- How many products now have care info
- How many products now have categories
- Overall improvement percentage

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **CSV not found**: Make sure you're in the right directory
2. **Import errors**: Check for special characters in descriptions
3. **Format issues**: Use semicolons (;) to separate features
4. **Encoding problems**: Save CSV as UTF-8

### **Need Help?**
- Check the generated reports in the root directory
- Review the import summary for specific errors
- Ensure all required columns are present
